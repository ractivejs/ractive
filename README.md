## What is Ractive.js?

It's a JavaScript library for building reactive user interfaces in a way that doesn't force you into a particular framework's way of thinking. It takes a radically different approach to DOM manipulation - one that saves both you and the browser unnecessary work.

Features include...

- Data-binding, with a beautiful declarative syntax.
- Event handling that doesn't make you tear your hair out.
- Flexible and performant animations and transitions.
- And much more!
