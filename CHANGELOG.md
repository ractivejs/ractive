# changelog

# 1.4.0 (edge, unreleased)

* Expermental new features
  * Computation setter functions now receive a context argument, and both getter and setter functions now receive a keypath argument.
  * Component styles can be split into multiple managed style tags in the document head by setting `Ractive.perComponentStyleElements` to `true`.
  * Methods that set a single value will now return the new value as the resolution of the returned promise e.g. `r.toggle('foo')` if `foo` is falsey will return a promise that resolves to `true`. `add`/`subtract`/`set` behave similarly.
  * Decorators and custom events can now access their local context, in the case of a yielded attribute partial, with `this.getLocalContext()`.

# 1.2.10, 1.3.13

* Bug fixes
  * Fix on definition file (#3348)
    * Now BaseInitOpts contains all lifecycle events
    * (Ractive|Static).extend now handle multiple params and return the correct type

# 1.2.9, 1.3.12

* Bug fixes
  * Track decorator args as expressions so that updates, so that they get notified when their deps change (#3329)
  * Wildcard computations now implicitly depend on their parent so that they get invalidated when the parent changes (#3331)
  * Wildcard computations in arrays are now included in a virtual get (#3333)


# 1.2.8, 1.3.11

* Bug fixes
  * Avoid an issue with linking a reference expression's dependencies when the underlying linked model hasn't actually changed and causing the same dependency to get added to the linked model exponentially on each new link.


# 1.2.7, 1.3.10

* Bug fixes
  * Fixes in typings.
  * Nested transition managers will no longer cause early detaches (#3224)
  * CSS ids that overlap will no longer cause the contained id to be duplicated e.g. with `table` and `tab`, `tab` would be duplicated.
  * Special refs that aren't `@context` but contain `context` in their path will no longer error (#3326)

* Breaking Changes
  * Observer callbacks that throw are now handled like computations that throw. This is technically a breaking change, but much more likely is that the previous behavior would cause Ractive's internal runloop to stall and cause unpredictable behavior.


# 1.2.6, 1.3.9

* Bug fixes
  * Escaped keypaths can now be observed correctly (#3319, thanks @ilessiivi)
  * Empty string templates will no longer cause an error during parsing.
  * Multiple references to the same model during capture for a computation will no longer result in ballooning dependencies.


# 1.3.8

See also the changes from 1.2.5 / 1.3.8 below

* Bug fixes
  * Additional aliases in a yield with context will now resolve correctly (#3316)


# 1.2.5, 1.3.8

* Bug fixes
  * Reference expressions that have their model disappear will no longer throw (#3308)
  * Radio name bindings are now properly initialized such that setting an initially set binding to `undefined` will actually apply the `undefined` (#3309)
  * Static attributes will be properly escaped again (#3311)


# 1.2.4, 1.3.7

* Bug fixes
  * Partials loaded from the registry, as opposed to being embedded in the template, now properly contribute expression functions for CSP (#3306)
  * Partials with a Context context will consistently find the correct parent element.


# 1.3.6

* Bug fixes
  * Improved macro typings.


# 1.3.5

* Bug fixes
  * The ractive binary should no longer barf on input and should more gracefully handle absolute vs relative paths.


# 1.3.4

* Bug fixes
  * The ractive binary now correctly resolves relative imports/links/hrefs for components in nested folders.


# 1.3.3

* New features
  * The ractive binary now supports loading partials from external files using a `src` attribute on the `template` element e.g. `<template id="my-template" src="./my-template.ractive.html">`. Currently, only `style` attributes at the top level of the resulting template are processed for inclusion, so `link` and `script` files are treated as if they appeared directly in an inline partial of the parent template.


# 1.3.2 / 1.2.3 / 1.1.4

* Bug fixes
  * Checked bindings will no longer interfere with click listeners that happen to be handled by the same delegate for non-IE browsers (#3299)
  * Nested transition events, possibly not related to any ractive transitions, will no longer cause active transitions on an element to terminate early.


# 1.3.1

See also the changes from 1.1.3 / 1.2.2 / 1.3.1 below

* Experimental new features
  * The current operation promise is available to things like observers and decorators using `Ractive.tick`, which will return `undefined` if there is not currently an operation in progress (#3295)


# 1.1.3 / 1.2.2 / 1.3.1

* Bug fixes
  * Dynamic partials with context will now have the correct context applied when they update (#3297)


# 1.3.0

* Bug fixes
  * Checkbox name bindings will now operate on a clone of the array, so that observers will get proper old and new values. This is a regression from the behavior in 0.7 (#3293)

* Experimental new features
  * Referencing a special `data` keypath on a Ractive instance that via the data model will automatically create a link to the target instance's data. The target instance can be accessed as a property of the instance e.g. `@this.myChildInstance.data.someKey` or directly in the data e.g. `ractive.set('myChildInstance', someInstance)` and `~/myChildInstance.data.someKey`.
  * Partials with context can now also supply aliases, which is useful for transplanting template supplied to a different component using the context object context support from 1.1.0 e.g. `{{>.content .context, true as remote, some.thing as item}}` where the `.content` template will have access to `remote` and `item` from the caller's context.


# 0.10.14 / 1.0.4 / 1.1.2 / 1.2.1

* Bug fixes
  * Checkbox name bindings will now operate on a clone of the array, so that observers will get proper old and new values. This is a regression from the behavior in 0.7 (#3293)


# 1.2.0

* Bug fixes
  * The Promise polyfill implementation is now slightly more accurate and includes `race` and `finally` implementations.

* Experimental new features
  * The source macro function is now available on macro handles, and macro functions are called with the nearest Ractive instance as the context.
  * You can get a handle to the nearest macro using the new `@macro` special reference.


# 0.10.13 / 1.0.3 / 1.1.1

* Bug fixes
  * Expressions in partials defined inline or in the partials registry are now collected into the expression map for CSP purposes thanks to @marcalexiei and @giovannipiller (#3285)


# 1.1.0

* Experimental new features
  * Supplying a `Context` object to a `{{#with}}` block will treat the context object as the container for its template, much like a `yield`.
  * Contexts now support `find`, `findAll`, `findAllComponents`, and `findComponent` that do the same thing as their synonymous instance methods, but they are scoped to the context.


# 0.10.12 / 1.0.2

* Bug fixes
  * String attributes that already have the same value as their new value will no longer be updated. This avoids a Safari issue wherein the cursor jumps to the end of an input where the value is manually bound (#3281)


# 1.0.1

See also the changes from 0.10.11 / 1.0.1 below.

* Breaking changes
  * The `noCssTransform` option has been renamed `noCSSTransform` to be consistent with the rest of the css methods and options. `noCssTransform` is still an alias for `noCSSTransform`, but this is a breaking change if you ever needed to check the `noCssTransform` property of an instance or Component directly e.g. `ractive.noCssTransform`.


# 0.10.11 / 1.0.1

* Bug fixes
  * Rendering a view with sub-components into an anchor will no longer cause the child components to freeze (#3271)
  * Event directives in view attached to anchors will no longer register duplicate listeners (#3271)
  * Static attributes are no longer set before the Ractive proxy is installed on an element for custom element pruproses (#3272)
  * Explicitly null data in a non-isolated instance will no longer cause an exception when the instance is attached to a parent (#3276)
  * Instance plugins are now installed before the fragment is created so that they can contribute to registries in time to have them resolve in the fragment
  * Special references that happen to contain `node` or `event` in their path after the actual special reference will no longer throw a parse error.
  * Decorators with context references in their arguments will resolve the correct context rather than the context of the parent element.

* Other changes
  * Element events no longer check to see if the event is defined on the element before attaching a listener. This makes it possible to listen to custom element events without having to create a custom event handler.


# 0.10.10 / 1.0.0

* Bug fixes
  * Conditional sections in attributes that happen to have another conditional section next to a nodeless directive (event, decorator, or transition) will no longer explode when trying to render
  * Shuffled iterative sections that are removed before they finish shuffling are now torn down fully (#3263)
  * The ractive bin will now mkdirp for single output files rather than dying if the target directory doesn't already exist
  * Transitions and lifecycle events that cause compound runloops will no longer leave some of the resulting Promises unresolved (#3266)

* Other changes
  * The `onconstruct` init option will be called for consistency with `on: { construct }` (#3267)


# 0.10.9

* Bug fixes
  * `extendWith` typings now have a correct return signature (#3259)
  * `helpers` are now correctly called with the instance as the context, and they also are now in the typings file
  * Transitions that happen to cause another runloop no longer cause runloop hangs (#3260)


# 0.10.8

* Bug fixes
  * Fragments rebound as part of a self-shuffling each block will no longer bind and unbind if the model doesn't actually change
  * `sharedSet` and `styleGet` now properly participate in capture


# 0.10.7

* Bug fixes
  * The bin now properly handles `$PARTIAL` references without a property access

* Other changes
  * `Ractive.getContext` will now check parent elements for context so that non-managed DOM that is owned by managed DOM can still be easily interacted with


# 0.10.6

* Bug fixes
  * Static style attributes will no longer get an extra semicolon tacked onto the end (#3257)
  * The `ractive` bin properly handles single file input again.


# 0.10.5

* Bug fixes
  * `@import` in CSS no longer blows up during transformation (#3254)
  * Adding a non-compliant object to the component registry will no longer cause an error (#3175)
  * The `ractive` bin will no longer die with `ERR_UNKNOWN_STDIN_TYPE` on Windows.

* Other changes
  * The component init code will now automatically handle module namespaces with a default export, so you can use dynamic imports to asynchronously pull in a Ractive component module e.g. `components: { thing: import('./Thing.ractive.html') }` (#3256)


# 0.10.4

* Bug fixes
  * Ambiguity warnings no longer consider alias blocks as contributing to ambiguity (#3238)
  * Boolean attributes are now passed to macros as `true` rather than empty strings
  * Whitespace removal during parsing is no longer overzealous (#3239)
  * Decorators that are unrendered before they fully render will no longer try to render and throw (#3241)
  * References to both `@this.root` and `@this` for components where `@this.root === @this` will no longer release z̪͆ͧ͂͊̽ͩ̿a̖͖l̂̍́ͭͨ̾̓gͥͨö̫̘̞̠͓͎̬̅ͣ̐͋
  * Checking for a listener from a context considers the an immediate component ancestor before the ancestor element (#3251)

* New features
  * There is a new mode in the bin that allows processing of an tree of components all at once. This is particularly helpful for generating TypeScript components, since the TypeScript compiler has no support for plugins. See the new `-id`, `-e`, `-oe`, and `-ae` flags for the `component` command.


# 0.10.3

* Bug fixes
  * Reference expression models will no longer re-register themselves exponentially when they are shuffled or relinked (#3232)
  * `on-load` events are no longer defered because `load` events typically only fire once, possibly as soon as the element is attached to the DOM (#3233)


# 0.9.14

* Bug fixes
  * Expressions in static mappings will no longer leak (#3201)
  * Reference expressions will now cause their source model to shuffle if necessary (#3234)


# 0.10.2

* Bug fixes
  * Calling `raise` on an element context that has no matching event no longer throws (#3226)
  * `@keypath` models are now kept fully up to date during a shuffle (#3228)

* Other changes
  * There is now an `unrendering` lifecycle event that fires before the instance unrenders, allowing access to methods that require the DOM to still be rendered, like `find`.


# 0.10.1

* Breaking changes
  * `getNodeInfo` has been removed after being deprecated for quite some time and being fully replaced by `getContext`.

* Bug fixes
  * `hasListener` now works correctly with an instance Context, like the ones provided by lifecycle events. Only components with `on-${event}` listeners in the controlling template can be queried with `hasListener`.

* Other changes
  * `on${event}` methods overriding super methods will warn if they don't also call `this._super()`.
  * There is now a `rendered` property on instances that can be used to determine whether or not they are currently live in the DOM.
  * Attributes that won't change are now managed statically for elements, which along with some other profiling-related changes results in a ~10% performance improvement over 0.9.


# 0.10.0

* Breaking changes
  * `resolveInstanceMembers` now defaults to `false` to avoid foot maimings associated with common instance member names and ambiguous references.
  * Template positions are now stored in the `q` member rather than the `p` member to avoid accidental overlap with partials.
  * The stringy syntax for computed properties has changed to plain old expression syntax. This means that `${length} * ${width}` as a computation is now just `length * width`, which is hopefully a little less surprising given `${interpolator}` syntax in template strings.
  * '.' in computation keypaths must now be escaped if they're meant to be part of a single key, as you can now add computations below the root level.
  * Checking that a value exists at some keypath in the data will no longer exclude the root prototypes (`Object`, `Function`, `Array`) because doing so creates issues when dealing with `Object.create(null)`. If you keep your references unambiguous, this shouldn't cause any issues.
  * Aliases now take precedent over properties from contexts above their alias defintions. This means that `{{#with { foo: 10 } }}{{#with 42 as foo}}{{foo}}{{/with}}{{/with}}` results in `42` rather than `10`, which makes it now behave in a slightly less surprising way.
  * `polyfills.js` is no longer included in the build, as it was just an empty placeholder since the handful of polyfills that were in it were included in the main build.
  * The context pop reference prefix `^^/` now correctly handles `{{#each}}` blocks such that `^^/ === ../../` from immediately within the block body. This is because `^^/` is supposed to jump explicit contexts and not just implicit contexts as provided by each iteration.

* New features (experimental, feedback welcome!)
  * There is now an `allowExpressions` parser and init option that disables the parsing of expressions when passed to `parse` or an instance with an unparsed template and disables the evaluation of expessions when passed to an instance. See #3000 for more info.
  * `{{#await some.promise}}promise is pending{{then value}}{{value}} is the result{{catch e}}error is {{e}}{{else}}some.promise is undefined{{/await}}`. In other words, we snagged the await block from Svelte.
  * Computations can now be added on the fly using `ractive.compute(keypath, computation)`, where `computation` is a string, function, or computation descriptor.
  * Computations can now be added to nested keypaths, and those keypaths may also be wildcards. To add an area to all `boxes` with a `length` and `width`, you can `ractive.compute('boxes.*.area', 'length * width')`.
  * There's a new `helpers` registry that can be used to store a flat map of helper functions (or bits of data) that will be checked first when resolving ambiguos references that don't resolve in the immediate context. This is also more or less cribbed from Svelte.'
  * Ractive now has a more universal plugin format that delegates to the appropriate registries but also has an opportunity to do more than just add to registries, like install new methods on prototypes, add observers and events listeners, and extend or replace CSS defintions. `Ractive.use(...plugins)`, `Component.use(...plugins)`, and `ractive.use(...plugins)` and the equivalent `extend` and `init` params `use: [...plugins]` take plugins in the form `({ Ractive, instance, proto }) => {}`, where `Ractive` is always the root `Ractive` constructor, `instance` is the component constructor for components and instance for instances, and `proto` is the component prototype for components and instance for instances.
  * Event directives now support initialization arguments in the form of `on-event(init, args)="handler"`, where the custom event plugin is called as `event(node, fire, init, args)`. This has a number of uses, including allowing long-throw events to provide feedback in the form of bindings and allowing filtering of key and or mouse events based on button or modifier key status.
  * You can add globally managed CSS to Ractive with `Ractive.addCSS(id, css)`, which is particularly useful for some types of plugins. You can check to see if global styles are already applied with `Ractive.hasCSS(id)` because `addCSS` will throw if you try to install the same styles twice. The `css` may be a string or a function that takes CSS data and returns a string, in which case it will be automatically recomputed when any variables it uses from the data are changed.
  * A component's CSS is now exposed on the constructor as the writable `css` property. Changing a component's `css` property will also update its styles included in the Ractive-managed style tag.
  * There's a new special reference, `@last` to get the index of the last iteration of an `{{#each}}`, which is particularly useful when iteration object values.
  * The `preserveWhitespace` option has been extended to also take a map of elements in which to preserve whitespace.
  * Reference expressions can now use an array member to expand to an arbitrary keypath e.g. `some[ ['extra', 'keys', 'here'] ]` is equivalent to `some.extra.keys.here`, but the array can be another reference that updates the target model dynamically.
  * You can now specify aliases to `@index`, `@key`, `@keypath`, and `@rootpath` as additional aliases in an `{{#each}}` block e.g. `{{#each items as item, @index as index, @keypath as path}}...{{/each}}`.
  * The `as` in aliases is now optional so `{{#each items as item, @index as index}}` is equivalent to `{{#each items item, @index index}}`.
  * You can now instruct an `{{#each}}` block shuffle itself when it updates rather than simply allowing the data to update in children to match any keypath changes. This means that you can now achieve shuffling with a computed expression that correctly transitions elements in and out of the DOM. This is done with a special alias `shuffle` for the `{{#each}}` block, which may be either `true` or a keypath as a string e.g. `{{#each items, true as shuffle}}` or `{{#each items, 'some.path' as shuffle}}`.
  * You can also instruct an `{{#each}}` block with a computed value to map its iteration contexts back to a source model using the `source` special alias, which should be set to underlying source of the computation e.g. `{{#each compute(some(items)), items as source}}`. Source contexts are determined using the `indexOf` method of the source array with the values from the computed array.
  * You can now specify a context for a yield rather than aliases if that better suites your usecase e.g. `{{#each things}}{{yield with .}}{{/each}}`. This makes the immediate context within the yield `things.${index}`, and the outer context can still be accessed with `^^/`.

* Bug fixes
  * Some corner cases causing context leaks from a template into a component have been plugged.

* Other changes
  * Ractive now uses prettier to make keeping the code style consistent easier, which will hopefully also make contributions easier.


# 0.9.13

* Bug fixes
  * Aliases, key refs, and index refs are now properly implicitly mapped when referenced from a non-isolated component (#3174)


# 0.9.12

* Bug fixes
  * Computations that manage to update outside of a runloop no longer throw (#3169)
  * Static mustaches no longer leak memory when they reference data linked in from another instance (#3183)
  * Obersvers that manage to get updated more than once in a runloop will now update correctly (#3184)
  * Transition and animation events are now whitelisted because they can't be automatically detected on IE (#3190)
  * Setting a bound multiple select to `undefined` no longer throws (#3194)


# 0.9.11

* Bug fixes
  * Reference expressions now properly handle wrapping or unwrapping values during `get()` thanks to @m-r-r (#3143)
  * Key and index refs will no longer cause an exception if they happen to become a context (#3145)
  * Event handlers on components are set up at bind so that any lifecycle events after `construct` can be attached as handlers in the template (#3148, #3159)
  * Decorators in conditional sections properly update when invalidated (#3152)
  * Partial expressions can be null again (#3154)
  * Partial expressions that update and resolve to the same value no longer reset their template (#3151)
  * IE doesn't have an `onmouseenter` or `onmouseleave` on SVG nodes, so we now check `window` for DOM events too (#3157)
  * Reference expressions fully participate in capture, so that computations using them via alias update correctly when the reference expression changes (#3163)
  * Linking to an instance mode e.g. `@.root` will no longer result in a memory leak when the linking instance is torn down (#3164)

* Other changes
  * The array of adaptors for an instance is now shared with its viewmodel once it has resolved - #3147


# 0.9.10

* Bug fixes
  * Computations and their children now unwrap and adapt correctly thanks to @m-r-r (#3130, #3137)
  * Computations and linked computations that are spliced will now invalidate rather than breaking the runloop (#3127)
  * Viewmodel teardown is deferred until lifecycle events are complete to avoid leakage due to mappings being expanded after teardown (#3131)

* Other changes
  * _Any_ type of event including component events are now targetable using `context.raise`
  * Context objects now include a `hasListener(name[, bubble])` helper that checks for event listeners available in the template from the context's position. By default, it only checks the immediate parent, but can be told to check all ancestors by passing `true` for the optional `bubble` argument.


# 0.9.9

* Bug fixes
  * Reference expressions no longer cause memory leaks (#3123)
  * Name bound elements that also have a bound value now have special-cased handling for when the value updates to keep the name binding up to date (#3124)
  * `<script>` tags in templates are automatically closed at the end of input because HTML doesn't special-case nested script tags (#3125)

* Other changes
  * The runtime build once again excludes the parser code, which managed to sneak back in amidst some build process udpates.


# 0.9.8

* Bug fixes
  * Binding attributes not owned directly by an element (conditional attributes) now behave correctly.
  * Yielded partials no longer find the wrong anchor node when rendering in certain circumstances (#3121)
  * Delegated events now play more nicely with `<use>` tags in certain environments (IE, older Safari, etc) (#3122)


# 0.9.7

* Bug fixes
  * The flag that tells partial templates to update no longer gets stuck causing unnecessary partial re-renders
  * Async components with sibling nodes are rendered in the correct order
  * The `old` option is available on pattern observers in addition to plain observers (#3118)
  * Triples now render correctly if they are rendered after the initial render (#3119)

* Other changes
  * Ractive will now warn you if it detects another global copy of Ractive during init (#3101)
  * The managed style element used for component CSS is now tagged with a `data-ractive-css` attribute (#3091)


# 0.9.6

* Breaking changes
  * Experimental parser transforms have been removed and replaced with a runtime construct associated with partials (see below)

* Bug fixes
  * HTML comments will now render (#3103)
  * Re-linking a linked path to itself will now throw a proper error instead of overflowing the stack (#3107)
  * Adapted values now reset and teardown correctly (#3100, #3112)
  * The default data for a component constructor is a function that returns an empty object rather than an empty object so that the component will inherit default data by default.
  * `sharedGet` and `styleGet` are now _actually implemented_ on Ractive constructors as was erroneously indicated in the notes for 0.9.4

* New features (experimental)
  * __Async components__: Components added to the component registry may be a promise or a function that returns a promise. While the promise is unresolved, the template will be left blank or display an options `async-loading` partial if supplied. When the promise resolves, the component will be rendered or supplied to an optional `async-loaded` partial as `{{>component}}` if the `async-loaded` partial is supplied. If the promise rejects, the template will be emptied or the `async-failed` partial will be rendered, if supplied.
  * The low-level construct that enables async components is the super or macro partial, which is also available for general use. A macro partial is one that provides a function that takes a context handle that can set the partial's template at any time.
    * Macro partials can also have scoped `css` using the same mechanism as components.
    * They are created with `Ractive.macro( ( handle, args ) => { ... }, { options } )` and should be passed into a partials registry
    * They can be invoked using regular partial syntax or using element syntax as a lightweight component e.g. `<macro attr1="{{foo}}">content partial</macro>`
    * The handle passed to the macro function can be used to:
      * Do anything a normal context object can e.g. `get`, `set`, `observe`, `listen`, etc
      * Create aliases to `@local` data for the macro's template e.g. `handle.aliasLocal( 'name' )` and `handle.aliasLocal( 'foo.bar', 'foobar' )`, which creates an alias `name` for `@local` and an alias `foobar` for `@local.foo.bar`, respectively.
      * Change the template for macro at any point using `handle.setTemplate( newTemplate )` where `newTemplate` can be a string or template script id if runtime parsing is available or a pre-parsed template.
      * The `template` property of the handle is a safe copy of the template AST containing the macro, and the `partials` property is a safe shared copy of the partials available to the macro.
    * The options available for `Ractive.macro` are:
      * `attributes` - an array of attribute names to reserve for the macro. Any attributes _not_ present in this array are collected and made available to the macro as the `{{>extra-attributes}}` partial.
      * `css` - a string or function used for creating CSS for the macro
      * `cssId` - the id to use for CSS scoping
      * `noCssTransform` - if `true`, the CSS will not be scoped
      * `cssData` - the base dictionary for the macro's style data
    * The return object from the macro function can include a number of callbacks:
      * `update(attrs)` - called whenever any reserved attributes change. If `handle.setTemplate` is called from this callback, it will _not_ trigger an additional turn of the runloop, so it's a relatively efficient operation.
      * `render()` - called when the template is rendered
      * `invalidate()` - called when any downstream template updates
      * `teardown()` - called when the macro is being removed from the template e.g. on unrender or if the dynamic name of the partial changes


# 0.9.5

* The `mjs` files are once again properly transpiled for those who use a `module` aware bundler with no transpiler.


# 0.9.4

* Bug fixes
  * Various bugs related to attaching child instances to anchors, including inherited partials, certain template constructs, and anchors inside iterative sections (#3060)
  * Style directives now reset safely e.g. don't change the inline style that they relate to if the value of that style doesn't match the expected value as last set by the directive
  * Event directives have properly deferred listener subscript (#3050)
  * Observers subscribed from the `observe` init option are deferred until after the instance fragment is created so that they can observe mapped and non-isolated data (#3053)
  * **BREAKING**: `{{else}}` and `{{elseif}}` are now considered to be block-closing, meaning that the `div` in `{{#if cond}}<div>{{else}}</div>{{/if}}` would already be closed in the else section, resulting in an error rather than a `div` with an interpolator referencing a keypath named `else` (#3051)
  * Array observers are now properly `strict` so that downstream modifications don't cause errant observations
  * Method calls on the immediate context are now correctly handled as `(this).method()` rather than `(this.method)()`
  * Same-named attributes in different branches of a conditional will now check to make sure the element attribute has an expected value before resetting (#3071)
  * `null` is considered an empty context when passed to `ractive.fire` (#3079)
  * The long-form of init events and observers will no longer get stuck in the wrong context after the first use (#3081)
  * Reference expressions will now shuffle correctly when their base model shuffles (#3092)

* New features (experimental)
  * `link`s can be supplied with a `keypath` option that allows them to track through shuffles rather than being absolute
  * The `css` extend option may now be a function that receives a data helper that can retrieve data from a new inherited component data registry `@style`
    * Any time the `@style` data for a component changes, the Ractive style tag will be updated with the recomputed result of executing the affected css functions.
    * Component constructors have new methods provided for accessing style data `Component.styleGet(keypath)` and `Component.styleSet(Object | keypath, value)`.
    * An instance can access its component style data using `@style` e.g. `this.get('@style.some.path')`
    * Computed styles will still be transformed so that they are scoped to the component unless the component is extended with css transforms disabled.
    * The root of the style data registry is on the `Ractive` constructor, so global style data can be accessed with `Ractive.getStyle` and `Ractive.setStyle`. Any sets from components override parent data for that part of the inheritance hierarchy.
    * The bin has been extended to handle dynamic css using `<script rel=css>`, which is transformed by using the content of the script as the body of a function `function (data) { ... }`. The `data` parameter name can be set with the `data-name` attribut on the `script` tag. A Ractive text-only template can also be used for dynamic css from a `<style rel="ractive">` or `<style href="..." type="text/css+ractive">` tag for inline or external templates, respectively. Note that evaluating Ractive style templates requires creating a dummy instance and is thus not as performant as the `<script>` method.
  * Ractive constructors also have `sharedSet` and `sharedGet` methods for accessing `@shared` data without requiring and instance
  * Components can request additional mappings during `construct` by setting `this.component.mappings` to an array of AST attributes or a string of mappings e.g. `mapping="{{.}}"` if runtime parsing is available. This is a low-level feature that's more intended for library authors than general users. (#3070)
  * Context objects now allow access to parent contexts using `context.getParent( crossComponentBoundary )`. This allows finer-grained access to template contexts than the element-only level offered by `ractive.getContext()`.
  * `ractive.fire` will reuse a context if the context has a truthy `refire` property (`context.refire = true`) (#3067)
  * `includeLinePositions` will no longer break partials nested within elements (#3082)
  * You can now access the context object prototype at `Ractive.Context`, so you can supply your own context object extensions (#3090)

* Other changes
  * The `construct` lifecycle event can now be subscribed from the `on` init hash
  * The `keep` option of `set` will now also keep DOM nodes, passing them through the progressive enhancement path on re-render
    * Kept `set`s are also pseudo-async because transitions may be involved, whereas non-kept `set`s will happily create duplicate DOM on the page while the old DOM is transitioning out.
  * **BREAKING**: `NaN` is considered to be an empty value in interpolators, like `null` and `undefined`.  If you need to render `NaN` on the page, then you can convert it to a string in the interpolator e.g. `{{ NaN + '' }}` or `{{ `${NaN}` }}`.
  * `{{yield}}` outside of a component context is now a noop


# 0.9.3

* Bug fixes
  * Plain objects can now be used to extend context when firing events (#3033)
  * Bug with transition params being non-objects (#3029)
  * Various fixes for delegation corner cases related to both nesting and disabled elements (#3036, #3046)
  * Root functions that are mapped to a component root maintain the owning instance as context (#3031)
  * Directive attributes within conditionals will now avoid rendering their directive form as an attribute on their owning element
  * The polyfills have been reduced to the minimum for ES5 support and included in the main build. There is no longer any need for the polyfills.js file for browsers that support ES5, which should include IE9+.
  * Links/mappings to indices and object iteration keys will now shuffle correctly (#3042)
  * `data` is no longer considered when `resolveInstanceMemebers` is true, so that the root model can't be accidentally corrupted when data is not fully initialized. `resolveInstanceMembers` will be defaulted to `false` for 1.0.
  * Reference expressions will now correctly invalidate when their target model is shuffled (#3045)
  * Bug with twoway bindings and more than one interpolator in the target attribute (#3043)
  * Boolean attributes that have a string value will now render the string into the target attributes (#3023)
  * Shuffling an unset keypath is now the equivalent of a `set`
  * Nodes within a triple mustache will now defer detachment until any containing elements with transitions are detached
  * `ractive.animate` will consider the `interpolator` option, if passed, when looking up an interpolator to use with the source and destination values

* New features
  * Decorators can now request that their owning element notify them when the element is invalidated i.e. when the element or some template that is part of its body will be updated. This is accopmlished by simply adding an `invalidate` method to the control handle returned by the decorator.


# 0.9.2

* Bug fixes
  * The bin now properly handles partial names with invalid identifier characters (`-`).
  * Computed setters are now called when a child is updated (#3006)
  * Shuffling `set`s and link-related shuffles properly invalidate any associated DOM (#3010)
  * Elements that happen to be children of a delegation target that are also not subject to delegation will no longer fire events twice (#3012)
  * `super` detection for `extendWith` is a bit more accomodating for ES6+ classes.
  * `css` that looks like it may be a selector will no longer throw if it's not a valid selector (#3005)
  * `input[type=file]` bindings will no longer try to set the value on blur, causing a DOMException (#3015)


# 0.9.1

* Bug fixes
  * Pattern observers will now fire even if there are other incidental changes caused by a shuffle (#2984)
  * Bindings now interact correctly with event delegation (#2988)
  * Styles set during transitions are now tracked individually and reset only if they have the expected value after the transition is complete (#2986)
  * CSS and JS transitions are now selected more accurately and don't interfere with each other if they happen to overlap (#2998)
  * Dotted mappings on components apply properly (#2060)

* Other changes
  * `ractive.target` is an alias for `ractive.el` to match the init params of sharing those names (#2977)
  * You can now access the `Parent` and `Ractive` constructors from any extension. The parent constructor was available before, but using the "private" property `_Parent`.
  * Ractive constructors now have an `isInstance` method that will return `true` if a given object is an instance of the constructor (#2914)
  * Context objects now have event delegation helpers `listen` and `unlisten` so that custom events and decorators can use delegation where appropriate.


# 0.9.0

* Bug fixes
  * Observers on uninitialized data may be added during the `config` event (#2725)
  * The unwrap option of `ractive.get` will now properly return the wrapped object if is set to `false` (#1178)
  * Overriding a Ractive prototype method during `Ractive.extend` without calling `_super()` will now issue a warning, as it's probably being done in error (#2358)
  * `toHTML` will output CSS scoping ids for components that have a `css` option specified (#2709)
  * `easing` functions that can't be run using CSS transitions will now cause the transition to be run as JS (#2152)

* Breaking changes
  * All deprecations have been removed, including proxy events with args, un-prefixed method events, decorator="...", transition="...", the ractive.data getter, partial comment definitions, and lifecycle methods like `init` and `beforeInit`.
  * With deprecations removed, directive values are now parsed with the plain expression parser, which doesn't automatically encode HTML entities in string literals.
  * The template spec is now a bit simpler after the removal of deprecations, and **templates parsed with previous versions of Ractive are no longer compatible**.
  * Partial context (`{{>foo thisIsTheContext}}`) now only applies inside the partial template, meaning it is no longer equivalent to `{{#with thisIsTheContext}}{{>foo}}{{/with}}`. The with is wrapped around the content of `foo`, so that the context doesn't interfere with the partial expression.
  * Any partial may be yielded, so yielding non-inline partials will no longer warn.
  * The same partial may be yielded multiple times.
  * Events now fire in an initial implicit `this.` namespace. This means that with `this.on( '*.foo', handler )`, `handler` will be called if and component fires a `foo` event or if the `this` instance fires a `foo` event.
  * The `noIntro` option now applies to any nested components that are also being rendered, unless they have their own explicit setting.
  * Legacy builds removed. Only regular and runtime builds are now available.
  * Library does not contain polyfills anymore for the following APIs:
    * `Array.isArray`
    * `Array.prototype.every`
    * `Array.prototype.filter`
    * `Array.prototype.find`
    * `Array.prototype.forEach`
    * `Array.prototype.indexOf`
    * `Array.prototype.map`
    * `Array.prototype.reduce`
    * `Function.prototype.bind`
    * `Node.prototype.contains` (only used in testing)
    * `Object.assign`
    * `Object.create`
    * `Object.defineProperty`
    * `Object.defineProperties`
    * `Object.freeze`
    * `Object.keys`
    * `performance.now`
    * `Promise`
    * `requestAnimationFrame`
    * `String.prototype.trim`
    * `window.addEventListener`
    * `window.getComputedStyle`
  * Ships with a separate, minimal polyfill file containing only the above APIs for older browsers.
  * `ractive.nodes` no longer contains elements by id. The same functionality can be handled more safely and conveniently with a decorator.
  * HTML elements are now exclusively created with a lowercase name.
  * Keypath expressions are no longer supported, as they are largely redundant with `getContext` functionality. (`@keypath(../some.ref)` is no longer a valid reference)
  * Unresolved references will now resolve to the immediate context rather than registering with every available context to be resolved when one of the contexts grows a matching base key.
  * Event directives within iterative sections will automatically use delegation (see below).
  * The undocumented `observeList` function has been moved to an option of `observe` (see below).
  * The `change` lifecycle event has been removed and replaced with recursive observers (see below).
  * Live element and component queries e.g. `ractive.findAll( 'some selector', { live: true } )` are no longer supported. If you need similar functionality, you can use a specialized decorator for elements or lifecycle events for components.
  * Linking a keypath that happens to be observed will now cause any observers to fire.
  * The `event` reference in event directives is deprecated, and all event handlers will now receive a context as their first parameter regardless of whether or not they originated with a DOM event (see below).
  * `ractive.merge` has been moved to an option of `set` to better reflect what it actually does (hint: it doesn't actually merge - see below).
  * Components are now isolated by default. You can change the global default by setting `Ractive.defaults.isolated` if you need the old behavior to be the default.
  * `ractive.runtime.js` is now named `runtime.js`, so if you require it, it is `require('ractive/runtime.js')`.
  * You can no longer create a component using another component as the options argument to `extend` e.g. `MyComponent.extend(OtherComponent)`. You can still extend a component with one or more options objects e.g. `MyComponent.extend({ ...options }, { ...other }).extend({ ...more })`.
  * `class-` directives are now parsed in an expression context, meaning that mustaches are no longer required. This normalizes templates into two categories: stringy things that require mustaches, and value things that don't. The `style-` directive remains in the stringy category.
  * The **magic** and **array** adaptors have been removed from core, though they may reappear as plugins.
  * `getNodeInfo` has been renamed to `getContext`. The old name is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  * Non-`isolated` components may now implicitly map during `set` operations. You can achieve the previous behavior by passing `isolated: true` as an option.

* New features (experimental - feedback welcome!)
  * You can now create cross-instance links by passing an options object with a target instance e.g. `this.link('source.path', 'dest.path', { ractive: sourceInstance })`. This covers many of the cases handled by the `ractive-ractive` adaptor in a considerably more efficient manner.
  * There is now an API to manage embedding external instances i.e. out-of-template components. You can use `ractive.attachChild(otherRactive, { options })` and `ractive.detachChild(otherRactive)` to create a component relationship between two instances. There is a new anchor construct `<#anchorName />` that behaves mostly like a regular inline component except that it won't create its own Ractive instance. You can target an anchor when attaching a child by giving an anchor name as an option e.g. `ractive.attachChild(otherRactive, { target: 'anchorName' })`. Attached children need not be components, so you can attach a plain Ractive instance e.g. `const foo = new Ractive({ ... }); ractive.attachChild(foo);`.
  * `{{yield}}` can now be used with any partial, not just inlines, and it may also use an expression to look up the target partial. It basically behaves as a regular partial with a special context.
    * `{{yield}}` can also specify aliases, so that yielding is useful inside an iterative section. `{{yield partialName with foo as bar}}` and `{{yield with foo as bar}}` will make `foo` from the component context available to the `partialName` partial as `bar`.
  * You can specify that child keypaths of computations should trigger updates on the computation's dependencies, which _should_ have the effect of keeping the models involved in the computation in sync with changes to the computed models. The flag to enable this behavior at instance creation is `syncComputedChildren: true`. With that flag set, children of computations are available for two-way binding and mutation from event or `getContext` objects using relative keypaths.
  * `@.foo` has been introduced as shorthand for `@this.foo`. This mirrors the data shorthand `.foo` for `this.foo`.
  * You can now pop contexts using `^^/` in the same way that you can pop keypaths with `../`.
  * Special keypaths that resolve to Ractive instances now resolve using the proper model rather than a computation, so they now stay in sync.
  * There is now a special key `data` on special keypaths that resolve to Ractive instances that resolves to the instance's root model. This allows things like `@.root.data.foo` to keep the root instance `foo` reference in sync throughout the component tree.
  * There is a new Ractive-private shared store, `@shared`. This is roughly the same as `@global`, but it is not susceptible to interference from the global scope.
  * There is a new option, `resolveInstanceMembers`, which defaults to `true`, and when enabled, it adds the instance scope `@this` to the end of the reference resolution process. This means that as long as there are no conflicting members in the context hierarchy, things like `<button on-click="set('foo', 'bar')">yep</button>` work as expected. Note that if the resolved function will only be bound to the instance if it contains a `this` reference, which can be a little strange if you're debugging.
  * There is a new option, `warnAboutAmbiguity`, which defaults to `false`, and when set, it will issue a warning any time a reference fails to resolve to a member in the immediate context.
  * API methods can now handle things like `ractive.set('~/foo', 'bar')`, mirroring how context methods for `getContext` and `event`s are handled. Things like `ractive.set('.foo', 'bar')` will now issue a warning and do nothing rather than creating an incorrect keypath (`<empty string>.foo`).
  * You can now trigger event listeners in the VDOM from event and node info objects e.g. with `<div on-foo="@global.alert('hello')" >` with `ractive.getContext('div').raise('foo');` will trigger an alert.
  * There are two new options available for subscribing events and observers when an instance is created using two new options.
    * `on` takes a hash of event listeners that will be subscribed just after the `construct` phase of instantiation, meaning that any lifecycle events after `construct` may also have listeners added in the event hash.
    * `observe` takes a hash of observers that will be subscribed just after the `config` phase of instantiation.
    * Both of these options are additive, so any subscriptions defined in component super classes are applied first in sequence from the root of the component class hierarchy down to the options of the instance being created.
    * The hashes can contain keys that could be passed directly to the matching method e.g. `ractive.on( key, ... )` or `ractive.observe( key, ... )`.
    * The hashes can contain values that are either a callback function or an object that has a `handler` property that is a callback function. If the object form is used, any additional keys are passed to the method. If a `once` property is supplied and is truthy, then the appropriate single-fire method will be used to subscribe. For instance `observe: { 'foo.* bar': { handler() { ... }, strict: true, once: true, defer: true } }` passed in an options object is equivalent to calling `ractive.observeOnce( 'foo.* bar', function() { ... }, { strict: true, defer: true } )` during the `init` phase of instantiation.
  * Event listener handles returned from `ractive.on( ... )` now have methods to silence and resume the listener. The existing `cancel()` method now has siblings `isSilenced()`, `silence()`, and `resume()`. When a listener is silenced, it will not call its callback.
  * Like event listeners, observer listener handles also have methods to silence and resume the listener. While an observer is silenced, it will still track state changes internally, meaning the old value on the next call after being resumed will be the last value it observed, including those observed while it was silenced. It simply won't fire its callback while it is silenced.
  * You can now stop component outros from firing while a component is being unrendered by specifying `noOutro: true`, which mirrors the behavior of `noIntro`.
  * You can now specify whether or not transitions should occur if they are on a child element of another transitioning element by using:
    * Instance option `nestedTransitions`, which defaults to `true`, meaning that transitions will fire whether they are on elements that are children of other transitioning elements or not.
    * The transition option `nested`, which also defaults to `true`.
  * There's a new `ractive` command distributed with the node module that allows easy pre-parsing of templates and building of components. If you have the module installed locally, see `./node_modules/.bin/ractive` for more details.
  * You can now specify required and optional attributes when creating a component with `Ractive.extend()` using the `attributes` option. The value of `attributes` may be an array of strings, specifying that all of the named attributes are optional, or an object with `required` and/or `optional` keys that each have an array of strings as their value.
    * If `attributes` are specified for a component, then by default any additional attributes passed to the component will not be treated as mappings directly but instead, will be collected into a special partial named `extra-attributes`. You can yield this partial in an element to apply the extra attributes to it, which allows passing things like `class` and `style` along to the main element in a component easily. Note that the extra attributes will _not_ create mappings by default, and you _must_ yield the `extra-attributes` partial to put it in the scope of the containing instance. `{{yield extra-attributes}}`
    * If the `attributes` object includes `mapAll: true` as one of its keys, then any extra attributes _will_ be mapped and the `extra-attributes` partial will contain attributes that reference the mappings, which means the partial should _not_ be yielded. `{{>extra-attributes}}`
  * Event delegation is now enabled by default for iterative sections. If the iterative section is contained within an element, then any event directives in the iterations will use a shared DOM listener on the element containing the section. You can disable delegation globally with `Ractive.defaults.delegate = false`, on an instance with `delegate: false`, or at the element level with the directive (attribute) `no-delegation` on the element containing the section.
  * Observers have been refactored with the following new options:
    * `array: true` will cause the observer to fire with an object containing lists of the added and removed elements. This option replaces `ractive.observeList`.
    * `old: function() { ... }` is a hook that allows you to set the `old` value that the observer passes to your callback. You can use this to freeze the old value, provide a deep clone, etc.
    * Using recursive path notation e.g. `some.path.**` or `**`, you can observe any changes to the data in a way that gives you the actual value and keypath that changed e.g. with `some.path.foo.bar.baz` changing to `42`, the observer callback would get `42` and the full keypath `some.path.foo.bar.baz` rather than the object at `some.path`, as with a regular or wildcard observer.
  * `ractive.set` now has the following new options:
    * `{ deep: true }` will cause the given value to merge into the target keypath e.g. with `foo` as `{ a: 1, b: { c: 2 } }`, `ractive.set( `foo`, { d: 3, b: { e: 4 } }, { deep: true } )` will result in `{ a: 1, b: { c: 2, e: 4 }, d: 3 }`.
    * `{ keep: true }` will cause any VDOM fragments that _would_ be torn down as the result of the `set` (or `add`, `subtract`, or `toggle`) to be retained. This makes it possible to have components in conditional sections not be destroyed and recreated as the section toggles.
    * `{ shuffle: true }` when used with an array will move any existing DOM corresponding to elements in both the new and old array to their new indices. The corresponds to the removed `merge` method. If you want to shuffle the array against itself, you can pass `null` as the new value e.g. `ractive.set( 'some.array', null, { shuffle: true } )`.
  * The first argument to the callback supplied to `ractive.on` will be a context object regardless of whether or not the event originated as a DOM event. This means that all event listeners share the same base callback signature. Any additional arguments to `fire` will follow the context argument.
  * The `event` reference for event directives has been deprecated and replaced by `@context`, `@event`, and `@node`:
    * `@context` is a Ractive context object that also has an `event` property continaing the original event and a `name` that is the name of the fired event.
    * `@event` is the original event object, so a `MouseEvent` for an `on-click` delegate.
    * `@node` is the DOM node to which the event directive is attached.
  * You can now re-proxy an event from an event directive expression by returning a single array with a `string` first element e.g. `<button on-click="['foo', arg1, arg2]">`, which is the equivalent of `@this.fire('foo', @context, arg1, arg2)`.
  * You can now use an existing class, be it ES5, ES6, or any other conforming implementation, using `Ractive.extendWith( MyClass, { ...extendOpts } )`. This allows `class Foo { constructor( opts ) { super( opts ); /* other init */ }, someMethod () { ... }, ... }` to be turned into a Ractive component.
  * To complete the split of template handling in to stringy mustaches and non-stringy expression values, the `bind-` directive has been introduced to bind an attribute value without mustaches e.g. `<input value="{{foo}}" />` is the same as `<input bind-value="foo" />`. This can be used with components to create mappings to same-named values in the current context e.g. `<component bind-item />`.
  * There is now a post-parsing hook available in the form of parser transforms, which are simply functions that receive a template element node and return a falsey value, telling the parser to do nothing, an object with a `remove` boolean, telling the parser to remove the node, or an object with a `replace` key, telling the parser to replace the node with the given content. Any expressions injected by parser transforms also participate in the CSP adjustment process. There is also a special reference `@local`, which only exists directly within a given context that is intended for use by parser transforms that need minor private state management.

* New features (stable)
  * `target` is now an alias for `el` when creating a Ractive instance.
  * You can now use spread expressions with array and object literals in expressions in addition to method calls. Object spreads will require `Object.assign` to be available.
  * There is a new lifecycle hook, `destruct` that fires after teardown is complete and any related transitions have completed.
  * Lifecycle events now receive the source Ractive instance as their last argument.
  * You can now use context-relative `observe` and `observeOnce` from event and node info objects.
  * You can now access decorator objects from event and node info objects using `obj.decorators.name`, where name is the decorator name as specified in the template e.g. `foo` in `<div as-foo />`.
  * You can now get the source keypath and Ractive instance for a link/mapping using `ractive.readLink( 'some.keypath' )`.
  * You can now use non-tagged template strings in your templates, and they will be replaced with the appropriate expression during parsing.
  * Setting a component name to a falsey value when creating or extending a Ractive instance will block use of that component e.g. `Ractive.extend({ components: { Foo: false } })` will cause `Foo` to be treated as an element.
  * The object passed to transition functions now has an `isOutro` property, which you can use to detect `ractive.transition`, wherein `t.isIntro` and `t.isOutro` will both be `false`.
  * Text nodes and interpolators will now use `splitText` for progressive enhancement, which should reduce or eliminate any flash during initial enhanced rendering.
  * Triples now support progressive enhancement, mostly using `outerHTML` to compare the target nodes to what should be rendered.
  * The `css` option for components can now specify an element or selector, and the `textContent` of the element will supply the value.
  * You can specify `{ force: true }` to `ractive.update` to force the target keypath to update event if internal checks determine that the value has not changed. This is useful for causing re-evaluation of all references to a function.

  * ... and various other bugs (#2679, #2680, #2695)

* Other
  * You can now specify a new parse option `contextLines` that will give you more (or less) of the surrounding template with errors and warnings.
  * There is a new global `Ractive.WELCOME_MESSAGE` that tools can use to control the welcome message that Ractive prints on first init.
  * Deprecated event constructs will now issue a warning with context for each instance, so that it becomes easier to find proxy events with arguments or old-style, non-prefixed method events in templates.


# 0.8.0

* Breaking changes
  * **Templates parsed with previous versions of Ractive are no longer compatible.**
  * IE8 is no longer supported.
  * Two-way binding is no longer allowed in computed contexts e.g. `\{{#each filter(someList)}}<input value="\{{.prop}}" />\{{/each}}` because changes to the computed child (`filter(someList).0.prop` aren't kept in sync with their source (`someList.?.prop`) as Ractive doesn't know how to reverse the expression. There is an ongoing discussion about how to address this, including an open PR that would put this behavior behind a flag and attempt to keep the sources up to date as the computation children changed.
  * Names in partial mustaches have been further relaxed to allow `/`s. They can also now handle relative contexts because partial name expressions no longer support spaces around the `.` delimiters in object paths. `\{{> foo.bar.baz .bat}}` before this change would have parsed as a single expression to get the partial name from `foo.bar.baz.bat`. It will now get the name from `foo.bar.baz` and have a context provided from `.bat`.
  * Other elements are no longer allowed within `<option>` elements.
  * Integer literals in interpolators are now considered to be integer literal expressions rather than references. They were considered references before so that you could access array members by index within a context. If you need to access an array member within a context section, you can still do so with `\{{this.0}}`.
  * The private `_ractive` tracking data added to Ractive controlled DOM nodes has changed significantly. The format of `Ractive.getNodeInfo` objects is still compatible.
  * `\{{#with obj}}` will no longer render if `obj` is falsey (https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive/issues/1856)
  * `modifyArrays` now defaults to `false`. If you modify arrays using splice operations directly, you will need to notify Ractive to sync with the changes afterwards.

* Deprecated features
  * Method event calls and proxy events with arguments are now deprecated and being replaced with {{{createLink 'Method calls' 'event expressions' }}}.
  * {{{createLink 'events' 'Event objects' }}} now have fairly comprehensive contextual helpers installed on them. The old `keypath`, `key`, `index` properties are deprecated.
  * Element directives are now supported inside of conditionals. Part of this change and that of event expressions has changed the template format, and this, compiled templates from previous versions of Ractive are no longer compatible. The template syntax, while evolved, is still compatible with previous versions. Some of the deprecated constructs will be removed in a future version.
  * The `intro`, `outro`, and `intro-outro` directives have been deprecated and replaced by named and suffixed directives `${name}[-in][-out]` e.g. `fade-in-out`. Arguments passed to these directives should no longer be wrapped in mustaches, as they are parsed as an array. Dynamism for transitions can be achieved with attribute sections.
  * The `decorator` directive has similarly deprecated and replaced by prefixed and named directives `as-${decorator}` e.g. `as-ace-editor`. Arguments passed to these directives should also no longer be wrapped in mustaches, as they are also parsed as an array. Multiple decorators are now supported by simply including multiple directives e.g. `as-registered="'some-id'" as-validated="{ maxLen: 10, match: /^foo/ }"`.
  * Accessing expression models via keypath is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Expression keypaths can overlap, which can cause unexpected things to happen for the overlapping paths. You can now use context methods on an event or node info object with relative keypaths to interact with expression contexts. For example: `\{{#with some.expression()}}<button on-click="@this.set(@keypath + '.foo', 42)">set .foo to 42</button>\{{/with}}` would become `\{{#with some.expression()}}<button on-click="event.set('.foo', 42)">set .foo to 42</button>\{{/with}}`.

* New features
  * Ractive's data handling has been completely rewritten to use a full viewmodel hierarchy as opposed to the previous hashmap-like implementation. This has made the code much easier to reason about, and it should also eliminate many data-related bugs. It also has made large swaths of Ractive considerably faster.
  * Spread arguments (`...arguments`) and `arguments` access is now available for method event handlers. Individual arguments are available using array notation (`arguments[n]`), dot notation (`arguments.0`), or `1`-based dollar vars, like regular expression matches (`$1`, `$2`, etc).
  * There is now support for linking data to extra keypaths in the model. This is particularly handy for master-detail scenarios where you have a complex list of objects and you want to focus on a single one at a time. A keypath like `'foo.bar.bazzes.0'` can be linked to `'baz'` so that the detail section doesn't have to worry about a non-bindable expressions or copying objects around. Both sides of the link are automatically kept in sync. See {{{createLink 'ractive.link()'}}}.
  * You can now use ES2015 object literal shorthand in templates e.g. `{ foo }` is equivalent to `{ foo: foo }`.
  * If you have object keys with `.`s in them, you can now escape them with a `\`. So if you have a `bar` object with a `foo.baz` property, it can be accessed with `bar.foo\.baz`. Keypaths in the template are given as escaped paths so that they can be used directly with Ractive methods. There are also a few new static methods on `Ractive` to deal with escaping, unescaping, splitting, and joining keypaths.
  * `<textarea>`s now handle HTML content as plain text to match what happens in browsers. They can now also set up two-way binding with a single interpolator as content instead of using the value attribute e.g. `<textarea>\{{someBinding}}</textarea>` is equivalent to `<textarea value="\{{someBinding}}"></textarea>`.
  * Progressive enhancement is now supported with a few limitations (see {{{createLink 'options' 'enhance' 'enhance'}}}). If you pass `enhance: true` when creating your Ractive instance, it will not discard the contents of its target element and will instead try to reuse elements and nodes as it builds the virtual DOM from its template. This option is incompatible with the `append` option.
  * The `Object`, `String`, and `Boolean` globals are now accessible from within templates.
  * You can now set up aliases with context and iterative mustache sections that can be used to clarify templates and avoid issues with object-literal context sections and two-way binding. For context sections, use `\{{#with someExpressionOrRef as alias1, some.deeply.nested[reference].expression as alias2}}...\{{/with}}` to set up as many aliases as you need. For iterative sections, you can alias the context with the iteration (the current item) by using `\{{#each some.list as item}}...\{{/each}}`. Partial contexts also support aliasing, since partial context is just a shortcut for `\{{#with context}}\{{>partial}}\{{/with}}`, as `\{{>somePartial some.path as alias1, some.other[expression](arg1, arg2) as alias2}}`.
  * There is a new CSP-compatible parsing mode that collects all of the expressions in the template at the end of the parse and stores them as `function`s on the template root. At render-time, any expressions look for a corresponding pre-built function before using `new Function(...)` to create one. Templates parsed in this way are no longer JSON compatible. To enable this mode, pass `csp: true` when pre-parsing your template.
  * If your environment supports it, you can now use Unicode characters from the Supplementary Multilingual Plane and the Supplemental Idiographic Plane in your templates.
  * There are two new special references available on your templates for access to the current Ractive instance and your environment's global object. `@this` will resolve to the nearest Ractive instance in the template, which includes components should the template belong to one. `@global` resolves to `window` in most browsers and `global` in Node.js. Both special references are also available outside of the template so that Ractive can be notified of changes outside the template easily.
  * Keywords can now be used as references, so you can now use `new`, `if`, `while`, etc as references.
  * Keypaths within components are now adjusted to be relative to the component. If you need to access the path to the data relative to the root instance, you can use the new special reference `@rootpath`.
  * Partials defined in `<script>` tags can now contain top-level inline partial definitions that will get added to the instance along with the scripte-defined partial.
  * You can now retrieve the CSS for a Ractive instance with a new `toCSS` method. You can also get the CSS for all instances with a new static Ractive method of the same name.
  * You can now trigger a transition with `ractive.transition( transition, node, options )`, and `node` can be supplied implicitly from an event handler. Transitions can now return a Promise and `complete` will automatically be called when the promise resolves.
  * Class and style attributes now get special treatment that keeps them from clobbering external changes. There are also special attribute forms for targeting a single class or inline style at a time using e.g. `style-left="\{{x}}px"` and `class-someClass="\{{someCondition || someOtherCondition}}"`. For the special style form, additional hyphens in the attribute are turned into camel case. For the special class form, the truthiness of the value determines whether or not the class is added to the list.
  * As `set` will create intermediate objects when setting an undefined keypath, array methods will now swap in an empty array instead of erroring when called with an undefined keypath. Trying to use an array method with a non-array value including `null` will still throw.
  * Event objects created by event directives and the results of {{{createLink 'Ractive.getNodeInfo()'}}} are now enhanced with a number of contextual helper methods to make interacting with Ractive in template-relative contexts programmatically easier. The old node info object properties are now deprecated, and their functionality has been replaced by the `resolve` and `get` methods.
  * Transitioning elements will not longer keep unrelated elements from being removed. Transitions now have a safety check that forces them to complete within a short interval from their target duration, which keeps misbehaving transitions and browsers from causing elements to get stuck in the DOM.
  * `elseif` and `else` blocks no longer include previous blocks' conditions in their own, so expensive computations are no longer repeated and conditions for `elseif` are no longer forced to be an expression. Instead, subordinate blocks connect with their siblings when they render and only show if all prior siblings have falsey conditions.
  * `merge` can now be called with the same array that exists at the given keypath, and the differences will be computed from the model's cached array members. This allows extensive in-place modification of an array to be handled as a series of splice operations but in a single operation. Note that `merge` may be moved to a `set` option at some pooint in the future.

# 0.7.1

* Fix version snafu

# 0.7.0

* Breaking changes
  * `ractive.data` is no longer exposed. Use `ractive.get()` and `ractive.set()` rather than accessing `data` directly
  * When instantiating or extending components, `data` properties on the instance/child component always override parent data

* Deprecated features
  * `ractive.debug` is replaced with a global `Ractive.DEBUG` flag (see below)
  * Inline partial definition comments (`<!-- {{>myPartial}} -->...`) should be replaced with inline partial sections (see below)
  * `options.data` should, if supplied, be a plain old JavaScript object (non-POJOs) or a function that returns one. Non-POJOs and arrays should only exist as *properties* of `options.data`

  * `elseif` in templates: `{{#if something}}...{{elseif otherthing}}...{{/if}}`
  * Element-level `twoway` directive for granular control over two-way binding
  * Element-level `lazy` directive, e.g. `lazy=true` or `lazy=250` to prevent or throttle data updates from user input

Partial definitions must exist at the top level of a template, or as an immediate child of an element/component
  * `ractive.set()` can be used to set multiple 'wildcard' keypaths simultaneously
  * `ractive.toggle(wildcardKeypath)` toggles all keypaths matching `wildcardKeypath` individually. Ditto `ractive.add()` and `ractive.subtract()`

* Triples behave correctly inside table elements etc (issue #167)
* Delimiters ('{{' and '}}') can be overridden globally with `Ractive.delimiters` and `Ractive.tripleDelimiters`
* Fix #130 (event handler parameters and array modification)
* Tap event respects spacebar keypresses while a suitable element is focused
* updateModel() method to resync two-way bindings if they are manipulated external (e.g. `$(input).val(newValue)`)
* Better handling of HTML entities
* Expressions with unresolved references will still render, using `undefined` in place of unknown references
* Hover event fires on the equivalent of mouseenter/mouseleave rather than mouseover/mouseout
* Various bugfixes and stability/performance improvements

# 0.3.6

* Better two-way binding - support for multiple checkboxes and file inputs
* Experimental 'magic mode' - use ES5 getters and setters instead of .set() and .get(). See [#110](https://github.com/RactiveJS/Ractive/issues/110)
* More efficient event binding, and dynamic proxy event names
* Support for pointer events with `tap` - thanks [lluchs](https://github.com/lluchs)

# 0.3.5

* Experimental support for components - see [this thread](https://github.com/RactiveJS/Ractive/issues/74) for details
* Support for [component](https://github.com/component/component) - thanks [CamShaft](https://github.com/CamShaft)
* Option to use `on-click` style event binding (as opposed to `proxy-click`)
* Bug fixes

# 0.3.4

* `ractive.find()` and `ractive.findAll()` convenience methods (equivalent to `ractive.el.querySelector()` and `ractive.el.querySelectorAll()`)
* Subclasses created with `Ractive.extend()` can now have a `beforeInit` method that will be called before rendering
* Expressions no longer need to be wrapped in parentheses. Section closing mustaches for expression sections can have any content
* Various minor bugfixes and improvements

# 0.3.3

* Maintenance and bugfixes

# 0.3.2

* IE8 support!

# 0.3.1

* Transitions - fine-grained control over how elements are rendered and torn down
* Inline partials
* ractive.observe() method
* Smart updates when using array mutator methods, reducing the amount of DOM manipulation that happens
* Changed proxy event and event definition API (BREAKING CHANGE!)
* Improved Ractive.extend
* SVG elements no longer require the xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' attribute - it is assumed, as it is in browsers
* ractive.animate() can accept a map of keypaths to values
* fullscreen convenience methods
* removed ractive.render() method
* added ractive.renderHTML() method, for rendering template+data (in browser or server environment)

# 0.3.0

* Major overhaul, particularly of the parser
* Expressions - JS-like expressions within templates, with robust tracking of multiple dependencies. These replace formatters
* Renamed Ractive.compile -> Ractive.parse
* Added adaptors (e.g. Backbone Model adaptors)
* Various performance enhancements and bug fixes

# 0.2.2

* Added event proxies. In lieu of documentation, for now, see [#27](https://github.com/RactiveJS/Ractive/issues/27)
* Made array modification more robust and performant

# 0.2.1

* Cleaned up some redundant code following 0.2.0 overhaul, some minor performance benefits
* Linting and refactoring
* Fixed bug where Ractive would attempt to use innerHTML with non-HTML elements (i.e. SVG text)

# 0.2.0

* Major architectural overhaul. Data is now stored on the Ractive instance rather than on a separate viewmodel, allowing for cleaner and more efficient code (at the cost of the ability to share one viewmodel among many instances - a theoretical benefit at best). Data is flattened and cached, permitting lightning-fast lookups even with complex data.
* Templates can be sanitized at compile-time to remove script tags and other hypothetical security risks. In lieu of documentation see issue #12

# 0.1.9

* More complete compliance with mustache test suite
* More efficient compilation (consecutive text nodes are concatenated, etc)
* Cleaned up public API, internal functions now kept private
* `.animate()` now interpolates between arrays, and between objects
* Complex element attributes wait until the end of a `.set()` cycle to update, to avoid repeatedly modifying the DOM unnecessarily
* Element property names are used instead of attributes wherever possible (e.g. we use `node.className='...'` instead of `node.setAttribute('class','...')` internally)
* Various bug fixes

# 0.1.8

* Now using DOM fragments for better performance
* Better support for legacy browsers
* Vastly better two-way data binding
* set() and get() now accept arrays of keys, for edge cases involving keys with periods
* Bug fixes and refactoring

# 0.1.7

* Renamed project from Anglebars to Ractive
* Added support for animation
* A shed-load of bug fixes, and a big dollop of refactoring

# 0.1.6

* Bug fixes!
* Modify arrays so that `pop`, `push` and other mutator methods trigger a view update
* Removed half-finished, flaky async code. Async mode may return later
* `set` events are called when a) `view.set()` is called, b) twoway bindings trigger them, c) array mutator methods cause an update

# 0.1.5

* Split into Anglebars.compile and Anglebars.runtime, to shave a few kilobytes off in production
* Simplified API - removed `compiled` and `compiledPartials` init options (in favour of allowing either compiled or string templates), and removed `observe` and `unobserve` instance methods
* Added event methods - `on`, `off` and `fire`
* `Anglebars.extend` for creating subclasses with default options (e.g. templates) and additional methods
* Support passing in jQuery collections (and lookalikes), and CSS selectors (if browser supports `document.querySelector`)
* Index references - `{{#section:i}}<!-- {{i}} evaluates to array index inside here -->{{/section}}`

# 0.1.4

* started maintaining a changelog...
