  "readme": "# exec-sync\n\nExecute shell command synchronously. Use this for migration scripts, cli programs, but not for regular server code.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installing npm (node package manager)\n``` bash\n$ curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n### Installing exec-sync\n``` bash\n$ cd /path/to/your/project\n$ [sudo] npm install exec-sync\n```\n\n### Using exec-sync from node.js\nWarning: use only for special operation or command line scripts written with node. Don't use this for regular server code or it will ruin the responsiveness of your server.\n\n``` js\nvar execSync = require('exec-sync');\n\nvar user = execSync('echo $USER');\nconsole.log(user);\n```\n\nBy default, an Error is thrown if stderr is not empty. Alternatively, the function can return an object with both `stdout` and `stderr` as properties by passing `true` as a second argument (`returnOutAndErr`).\n\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011-2012 Jérémy Faivre &lt;contact@jeremyfa.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",
