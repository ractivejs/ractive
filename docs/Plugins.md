# Plugin List

It may not be apparent but Ractive is actually built with extreme extensibility in mind. Plugins allow you to augment Ractive with extra functionality. Whether you're a JavaScript developer, an interface designer or just trying to get away from your framework overlords, Ractive can accomodate one and all.

## And so much more!

Due to the nature of how easy it is to write and distribute plugins as well as how diverse the distribution channels are, we cannot possibly know what other Ractive plugins exist in the wild.

To discover more, try searching your favorite package manager, search engine, or code hosting service for the keyword "ractive". I guarantee you'll be surprised.

<small>Note: Like any other open-source project, these plugins may not have been maintained for a while. Should bugs arise, we highly encourage reporting the issue to relevant parties so that it can be addressed.</small>
