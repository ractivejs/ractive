title: Using Ractive with Backbone

If your app uses Backbone to manage your models and collections, you can use them seamlessly with Ractive by using an {{{createLink 'Ractive.adaptors' 'adaptor'}}}.

[Download the Backbone adaptor here](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive-adaptors-backbone), or see an [example](http://examples.ractivejs.org/backbone).
