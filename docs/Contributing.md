Ractive is a community-driven project. Most of its best features were [suggested by users like you](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aenhancement%20). There are a lot of ways you can contribute to the project. Here are a few examples:

# Contribute code

An open pull request is better than one that's never submitted. [Pull requests](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive/pulls) are always welcome.

# Write documentation

Each page in the documentation is just [a file written in markdown](). Again, [pull requests](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive/pulls) are always welcome.

# Write plugins

Extend Ractive in ways you've never seen before. Interface with other libraries, create effects, widgets, interactions, custom elements, and so much more with Ractive's very extensible core.

Refer to [Plugins]() for details on how to start writing Ractive plugins.
