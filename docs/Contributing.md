Ractive.js is a community-driven project - most of its best features were suggested by users. If you think something is missing from the library, [come over to the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ractive-js) to discuss it with other users.

Pull requests are always welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive), though for non-trivial proposals it's best to discuss it on the mailing list or raise an issue first.


## Other ways to contribute

* Spread the word! The larger the community using Ractive, the better it becomes. Write blog posts, mention it to your developer colleagues and friends, submit talks (here are some [tips on speaking at tech meetups](http://speaking.io/)).
* Fix documentation. Each page on this site has an 'edit' button in the top right, which will take you to GitHub where you can submit fixes. If you spot an error or think something's missing and aren't sure how to fix it, [raise an issue](https://github.com/ractivejs/docs.ractivejs.org/issues).
* Help other developers on StackOverflow. Subscribe to [questions tagged 'ractivejs'](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ractivejs), and you'll get alerts when someone asks a question that you might be able to answer.
* Write plugins. See the {{{createLink 'Create plugins'}}} page for more information.

But above all, build stuff! If you make something with Ractive, we'd love to hear about it on the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ractive-js) and on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/RactiveJS).
