title: Preparsing Templates
---
Before Ractive can render a template, it has to *parse* it. Parsing consists of reading the HTML and constructing a tree-like structure that represents the structure of the HTML, but also {{{createLink 'mustaches'}}} and their {{{createLink 'references'}}} or {{{createLink 'expressions'}}}, along with any other concepts that aren't represented by HTML such as {{{createLink 'transitions'}}} and {{{createLink 'event proxies'}}}.
