title: Content Security Policy
---

To use ractive with [Content Security Policy](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/), you'll currently need `'unsafe-eval'` specified for `scriptSrc` in your CSP header.

This may change in future - see https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive/issues/1897 .
